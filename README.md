# Research_Supermarket_Sales
Research with statistical analysis on R to better understand supermarket customers' behaviour.

# ABSTRACT
This research examines supermarket data to be a light for understanding the customers' behaviors
considering the parametric and non-parametric data analysis approach. In addition, this research
is conducted to investigate which factors change the customer's total price and
which variables affect or do not affect the customerâ€™s total price. In the light of this problem,
firstly, an analysis of the significant difference between the supermarket infrastructure and
conducted data in the aspect of averages/medians has been done. Secondly, it was checked
whether there was a significant difference between customers' supermarket expenditures
regarding to payment method, membership type, and supermarket branch. Lastly, it has been
investigated whether gender and product type affect total expenditures. As a result, these findings
showed that supermarket expenditures might vary according to certain factors and are not
affected by specific variables which are hypothesized in advance.

## ABSTRACT
This research examines supermarket data to be a light for understanding the customers' behaviors
considering the parametric and non-parametric data analysis approach. In addition, this research
is conducted to investigate which factors change the customer's total price and
which variables affect or do not affect the customerâ€™s total price. In the light of this problem,
firstly, an analysis of the significant difference between the supermarket infrastructure and
conducted data in the aspect of averages/medians has been done. Secondly, it was checked
whether there was a significant difference between customers' supermarket expenditures
regarding to payment method, membership type, and supermarket branch. Lastly, it has been
investigated whether gender and product type affect total expenditures. As a result, these findings
showed that supermarket expenditures might vary according to certain factors and are not
affected by specific variables which are hypothesized in advance. 

## Introduction

Supermarket companies, especially in big cities, have to understand customer behavior and create price ranges suitable for them due to the competition among them. At the same time, customers form their shopping habits by considering various factors such as product variety, price comparison, and payment methods while spending in their supermarkets. This mutual association between supermarket brands and customers is made possible by both stakeholder understanding of supermarket infrastructure. For this reason, the data has been shaped around various hypothesis tests for the consumer and supermarket infrastructure owner to understand this complex structure.
There are some obvious factors in the supermarket market that the total price will increase as the customer buys more products, or the linear relationship of the tax to the number of customer's expenses, but is the total price spent by the customer only consist of these facts?

The knowledge that a supermarket membership has an impact or not on the total price is an essential matter for customers and supermarket owners. The reasons are the business policy to be followed by the owner and whether the company should give priority to membership or not, which would be apparent through the profit results regarding the membership. The essentiality of this information also applies to the customers. In today's world, grocery shopping is becoming a situation that must be considered more and more from the customer's point of view. Customers no longer buy a product with passion as they see something they are interested in. They need to consider their economic situation since everything is more expensive now. That is why they spend money more carefully. Therefore, knowing whether the membership has changed or not changed the customer's total price provides the customer with an economical relief option.

Another necessary information would be how products price change in different lines for the supermarket market. Every customer has an area of interest. Hence, the economic impact of these areas of interest is vital to the customers. It provides an idea of the future expenditures for the customer's interest through the information of more or fewer expenses compared to other interests. Customers may decide to suppress their interest and passion or be relieved about their interest if their interest is more economically viable than other expenditures through the information they acquire regarding product line expenses. Similarly, the product line is essential for supermarket owners; depending on which product line makes more money, the company can put those products line on high shelves or put them in the most visible place in the market.

Whether the supermarket market affects the customers' interest or whether membership has an effect or not on the customer's expenses is a curiosity. However, another matter of curiosity would be whether these expenditures are mostly made with cash or credit cards and whether this payment preference makes a difference regarding gender or not. The conducted supermarket data has the potential to eliminate these obscurities through the methods that are done in this research which are indicated in the following figure;
